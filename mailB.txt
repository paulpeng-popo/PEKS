Swordland is probably one of the most iconic soundtracks 
from the Sword Art Online series and it's still being used 
in important key moments in the currently airing SAO Alicization 
Anime series. It's one of my favorite compositions from Yuki Kajiura, 
mainly because of the brilliant harmonic progression in the 
majestic main theme.
